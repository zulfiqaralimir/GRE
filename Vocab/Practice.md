One time, I helped my friend, Sarah, who was struggling with her mathematics coursework. She was really stressed out because she had an important exam coming up and she was finding it difficult to understand some of the key concepts.

Sarah's difficulties were quite **aberrant** (departing from the normal) considering her usual **acumen** (keen insight) in other subjects. Recognizing her **alacrity** (eagerness) to improve, I offered to tutor her for a few hours each week leading up to the exam. We would meet at the library after school, and I would go through the material with her step by step, explaining the concepts in a way that made them easier to understand. I also helped her practice by solving different types of problems together.

I **abstained** (restrained oneself from doing something) from my usual after-school activities to ensure I had ample time to help her. We tackled each **anomaly** (something that deviates from what is standard) in her understanding with care. At times, the concepts seemed **arcane** (understood by few) to her, but my **assiduous** (showing great care) efforts helped demystify them.

I decided to help her because I knew how important this exam was for her future, and I had a good grasp of the subject matter. Also, Sarah is a good friend, and I wanted to support her during a challenging time.

As a result of our study sessions, Sarah became much more confident in her abilities. She started to understand the concepts that had previously been difficult for her, and she was able to solve problems more easily. On the day of the exam, she felt well-prepared and, in the end, she passed with flying colors. She was very grateful for my help, and it made me feel good to know that I had made a positive difference in her academic journey.
