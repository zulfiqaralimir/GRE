### Analytical Writing

The Analytical Writing section assesses your critical thinking and analytical writing skills. It consists of two tasks:

1. **Issue Task**:
   - You will be presented with a statement or claim about a general topic.
   - Your task is to develop a well-reasoned argument in response to the issue.
   - You should consider multiple perspectives and support your position with relevant reasons and examples.
   - This task evaluates your ability to think critically and express your thoughts clearly and persuasively.

2. **Argument Task**:
   - You will be given a short passage that presents an argument.
   - Your task is to evaluate the logical soundness of the argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.
   - You should identify the strengths and weaknesses of the argument, considering the evidence provided and its logical coherence.
   - This task assesses your ability to understand, analyze, and evaluate arguments and to communicate your analysis effectively in writing.
