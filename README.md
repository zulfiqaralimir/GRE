### Sections of the GRE General Test

The GRE General Test is divided into three main sections:

1. **Analytical Writing**: This section assesses your ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and effectively, examine claims and accompanying evidence, support ideas with relevant reasons and examples, and sustain a coherent discussion. It consists of two tasks:
   - **Issue Task**: You are presented with a general statement or claim and asked to provide your perspective on the issue.
   - **Argument Task**: You evaluate a given argument according to specific instructions.

2. **Verbal Reasoning**: This section measures your ability to analyze and evaluate written material and synthesize information obtained from it, analyze relationships among component parts of sentences and recognize relationships among words and concepts. It includes:
   - Reading Comprehension
   - Text Completion
   - Sentence Equivalence

3. **Quantitative Reasoning**: This section measures your ability to understand, interpret, and analyze quantitative information, solve problems using mathematical models, and apply basic mathematical skills and elementary mathematical concepts of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data analysis. It includes:
   - Quantitative Comparison
   - Problem Solving

Additionally, there may be an unscored research section used for pretesting new questions. This section is not counted in your score but is essential for ETS to ensure the validity and reliability of test questions.
